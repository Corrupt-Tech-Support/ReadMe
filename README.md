# ReadMe

Hey, Owner of the Org here,

  I would just like to make something clear before anyone continues any further down this list, just incase anything were to happen at all.
  
  ## None of the participants are responsible for any damage to any system or electronic device that may happen when using any of our programs!!!
  
  I'm serious. Not one person that participates in making these viruses are responsible for any damage that may happen. We make these for our own personal experience, and sometimes, just to fuck around. Oh, and also...
  
  ## We are not making these for any malicious use at all!
  
  There may be some keylogging program on here, or maybe something that corrupts everything on your Windows PC, but, like I said before, we are doing it to fuck around or for personal experience. Please don't use this to attack someone or get back at anyone.
  
  We will be including a warning in every repository that may include one of the following above...
